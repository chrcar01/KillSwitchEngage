KillSwitchEngage Reference Architecture
=======================================

This is a work in progress.  Less of a "how to" and more of a "show and tell" for the current project I'm working on.  There are so many framesworks, tools and technologies out there.  Many of them have great documentation, but there isn't a lot of guidance on how we "should" be stitching them together.  

Main Technologies/Tools/Frameworks:

* WPF/C#/.NET 4.0
* [Entity Framework 4.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx)
* [Magellan 2.0](http://code.google.com/p/magellan-framework/)
* [MVVM Light Toolkit 3.0](http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/)
* [Avalon Dock](http://avalondock.codeplex.com/)
* [Enterprise Library 5.0 Logging](http://entlib.codeplex.com/) hidden behind [Simple Logging Facade](http://slf.codeplex.com/)
